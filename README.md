# Vending-Machine
This project desings a functional vending machine using object orientated programming. We create classes for products, currency, andthe vending machine itself along with a helper class that checks to make sure that the input is valid.
The program design allows for a lot of variety as you cam create any type of coin and any type of product.
The desing of the venidng machine project uses Encapsulation and Polymorphism as well as provides as an example for Abstraction and Interface implementation.
